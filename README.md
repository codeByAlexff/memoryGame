# Game of Memory: Swift App Project Plan
---
## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Initial Setup: 
    - Display 10 cards face down on the game board, consisting of 5 unique pairs.
  • Randomization: 
    - Shuffle card locations for each new game.
  • Animations: 
    - Include flip animations when a card is tapped and match animations when two cards are successfully paired.
  • Game Completion: 
    - Show a completion screen with the player's score and time taken.

### Game Modes

  1. Timed Mode
    • Countdown timer (e.g., 60 seconds).
    • Score based on matches and remaining time.
    
  2. Study Mode
    • Allow users to create custom card sets.
    • Provide an input interface for adding image-text pairs.
    • Option to review created cards before starting the game.


### User Profile

  • Username and avatar selection.
  • Personal statistics (games played, best times, etc.).


### Leaderboard

  • Personal best scores for Timed Mode.
  • Sortable by date and score.

### UI/UX Design

  • Clean, intuitive interface.
  • Smooth animations for card flips and matches.
  • Color scheme options (light/dark mode).

## Technical Considerations

### Swift and iOS Features to Utilize

  • SwiftUI:
    - Leverage for modern, responsive UI design.
  • Core Data:
    - Use for local data persistence.
  • CloudKit:
    - Enable user data syncing across devices.
  • GameKit:
    - Integrate for leaderboard and multiplayer functionality.

### Backend Requirements

  • User Authentication:
    - Implement using Firebase or a custom server.
  • API:
    - Develop a RESTful API for global leaderboard and multiplayer features.
  • Cloud Storage:
    - Store user-generated content (study cards) in the cloud.


### Performance Optimization

  • Efficient Image Loading and Caching:
    - Ensure smooth performance.
  • Smooth Animations:
    - Maintain performance across all devices, including older models.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

  • Unit Tests:
    - Write tests for core game logic.
  • UI Tests:
    - Ensure critical user flows work seamlessly.
